# Ai-Core-Hangman
 Project created as part of AiCore Data Analytics course.

## Project Title: 
Hangman

## A description of the project: 

This is a classic hangman game where the user has to guess the letters in the word correctly. A list of fruits is given as the guessable word options, and the random.choice method is used to randomly select one for the user to guess. The user has an unlimited number of guesses so long as they guess correctly, and 5 guesses if they are not correct. 

The game was completed following instructions on what the game should do, step-by-step, provided by AiCore.

## What I learned:

Learning points:
- Learned how to utilise GitHub for my projects.
- Reminded myself of the syntax and functionality of many of the basic Python functions (e.g. .enumerate(), .isalpha(), .lower()).
- Having only ever used OOP in Java, the project enabled me to learn how to use OOP in Python.
- Created 'main' file to practice.
- Completing the project in separate milestones, there were many bugs in the project along the way, especially infinite loops, which I left in place at the different milestone points to enable me to follow the instructions in order.
- Resolved bugs around unique letters/repeated letters.
- Veered from instructions to make game more inteactive through print statements, added an option for a hint once user only has 1 life left and an option to to play again or exit at the end of a game, and added a twist whereby user gains a life if they guess a letter correctly.

## Installation instructions and usage instructions:

Programme should be run from 'main' file.

## File structure of the project:

There is a separate numbered 'milestone' python file to correlate with the order of the tasks assigned.
